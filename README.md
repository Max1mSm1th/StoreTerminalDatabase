Introduction:

This assignment required me to utilize mySql and Node.js to develop an application within the terminal that allowed for customers to purchase available product. 


Development:

To start off, I used the mySQL workbench to put together a 10-item database with various products and prices. From there I linked it to a .js file and began pulling the data into the application.


Challenges:

This was definitely one of the more challenging projects thus far in the course. While the creation of the mySQL tables came easy to me, it was the ability to pull specific rows from said table that was the challenge. 

Another challenge I had was figuring out how to change existing data (i.e. the prices) in the database. 


Overall:

This assignment really challenged me to focus on psuedo-coding first and THEN do the actual coding. Too often I jump straight into the coding and get lost.
